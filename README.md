The three-point estimation technique is used in management and information systems applications for estimating the outcome of future events, based on very limited information. While the distribution used for the approximation might be a normal distribution, this is not always so and, for example a triangular distribution might be used, depending on the application.

In three-point estimation, three figures are produced initially for every distribution that is required, based on prior experience or best-guesses:

    b = the best-case estimate
    m = the most likely estimate
    w = the worst-case estimate

Based on the assumption that a triangular distribution underlies the data, several estimates are possible. These values are used to calculate an E value for the estimate:

    E = (b + 4m + w) / 6
